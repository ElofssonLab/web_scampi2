DESCRIPTION:
    This is the web-server implementation of the TOPCONS 2.0 workflow.
    The web-server is developed with Django 1.6.4

    TOPCONS 2.0 is an updated version of the widely used TOPCONS for predicting
    membrane protein topologies using consensus prediction.
    It is faster yet more accurate than the old TOPCONS according to our solid
    benchmarking. Moreover, it predicts not only the trans-membrane helices,
    but also the location of signal peptide

    TOPCONS 2.0 may be used for the purpose of academic research only.
